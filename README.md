# Power-Pivot-Project
This is a significant project, where I used the Power Pivot feature, to evaluate the total sum of sales done by a fruit firm.
With the provision of a FACT table (Table 3), and a DIMENSION table (Table 4), using the power pivot, the two tables were merged using their PRODUCT ID, to get their individual prices of the product ID and sum total of all fruit items, using the PIVOT TABLE.
